# Scripts for Screeps

/!\ Anyone can use this - open game knowledge is open!
/!\ Screeps is in it's Alpha stages right now - the scripts may not work one day. If so, notify me at my GMail (unysnhyperum)

Hello there, this is Aaron.

In this repo resides my scripts for the game 'Screeps' available here online (screeps.com). I hugely reccomend the game. It is an excellent learning tool for people of all ages and ranging between computer newbies to scripting professionals. I myself am not a scripting proffessional (though I do program) but this game has taught me quite a bit.

Again, Screeps is an awesome learning tool for kids and adults alike.

Soon, this document will include a mini-tutorial and FAQ. Stay connnected.
